    "### Planning Agent / Send Sucky Home Efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Your GoHomeAgent from Lab 1.  It explores around and sucks dirt until its battery reaches a threshold level, then tries to find its way back to (1,1).  Lacking the ability to plan, it does not do so very well\n",
    "2.  The PlanningAgent introduced the concept of a *path*  -- a list of squares from A to B such that the path begins at A and ends at B and every square in the list is not a wall, and is *adjacent* to the ones surrounding it.  The planning agent also has the code to make Sucky follow a path.\n",
    "3.  The module ``shortestpath.py`` builds a path, and it is missing.  It implements a function ```shortest_path(source_pos, dest_pos, free_squares)```.  You need to implement that function using the search module from Lab 2.   This notebook will help you do write that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the ```shortest_path``` function working, you will then copy it to a file ```shortestpath.py``` and you will copy in your ```GoHomeAgent``` from lab 1, and you will modify the agent so when its battery reaches threshold it will plan a path from where it is to (1,1), then execute the plan, then execute the action ```ACTION_STOP```\n",
