==================================
Plans
 * Add begin_plan and continue_plan
 * Added super secret path planning module
 * Added ability for world model to remember squares with gold, dirt, and walls
 * Use case:  single gold, Sucky knows about gold and walls.  Plan to pick up the gold
    then return to [1,1] then unload then stop

==================================

Macro Actions
 * Add multiple actions and move to square
 * Add MacroActionAgent 
   * Key feature is just maintaining next_actions attribute
   * Use case is using next_actions to implement move_to_adjacent_square
     in context where agent knows about walls 
 * Take-aways
    *  Action policy rules are cleaner. 
    *  Works better than sense dirt agent, but really this is just 
        due to being told about the walls
    * Teaser -- if they haven't done it already, agent would benefit 
        from preferring to move into squares it hasn't seen before


After world model refactor
  * Added WorldModelAgent and agentworldmodel;  policy is the same as SenseDirtAgent,
     but all interaction with world model happens through interface


Starting point for lab 1
  *  Gold is available but turned off in config file
  *  Command processing is available (command widget and send_user_command method)
  *  Agents shipped:  NoSenseAgent and SenseDirtAgent (both in reactiveagent.py)
