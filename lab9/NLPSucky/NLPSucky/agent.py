    will depend on the specific environment in which the agent exists.)
    Note that 'program' is a slot, not a method. If it were a method,
    then the program could 'cheat' and look at aspects of the agent.
    It's not supposed to do that: the program can only look at the

    the agent itself) will have to build and maintain its own model.

    the performance measure of the agent in its environment."""
