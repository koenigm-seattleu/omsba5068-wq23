    "\n",
    "In the previous lab our Vacuum / Gold agent had perfect information about the world ahead of time, so knew where all the gold was without needing sensors to tell it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example it does not know the position of gold ahead of time, and has an imperfect sensor to tell it where gold is.  (Its **DIRT** percept/sensor was perfect in that if it were in a square and got the **DIRT=True** percept it knew for sure that there was dirt in the square, and if it got the **DIRT=False** percept it knew for sure that there was no dirt in the square.)\n",

    "Here we will consider a 2x2 grid with no walls and no dirt:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   _         | Col 1      | Col 2      |\n",
    "| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n",

    "Gold appears randomly in the grid;  in each cell in Row 1, gold appears 40% of the time, and in each cell in Row 2, gold appears 20% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent gets a **GLITTER** percept when it enters a cell, and its True/False reading depends on whether or not there is gold in the immediate cell, and in the two adjacent cells.   For example, the **GLITTER** percept for [1,2] depends on whether or not there is gold in [1,2], [1,1], and [2,2].\n",
    "\n",
    "You have observed the following behavior for this sensor in a particular square:\n",
    "1.  If there is gold in the square *and* there is gold in at least one adjacent square, 85\\% of the time the percept value will be True, and 15\\% of the time the percept value will be False.\n",
    "2.  If there is gold in the square but no gold in either adjacent square, 75\\% of the percept value will be True, and 25\\% of the time the percept value will be false.\n",
    "3.  If there is no gold in the square but there is gold in one or both of the adjacent squares, 50\\% of the time the percept value till be True, and 50\\% of the time the percept value will be False\n",
    "4.  If there is no gold in the square or either adjacent square, 10\\% of the time the percept value will be True, and 90\\% of the time the percept value will be False."
