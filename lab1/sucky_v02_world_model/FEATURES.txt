World model

After world model refactor
  * Added WorldModelAgent and agentworldmodel;  policy is the same as SenseDirtAgent,
     but all interaction with world model happens through interface


Starting point for lab 1
  *  Gold is available but turned off in config file
  *  Command processing is available (command widget and send_user_command method)
  *  Agents shipped:  NoSenseAgent and SenseDirtAgent (both in reactiveagent.py)
